SETUP:

# Naming & Workflow:

- guests are users not yet registerd. They can add products to cart but they'll need to signin or signup in order to checkout.

- signin (login) for registered user to login. The form will be validated but then the random user from DB (Monika!) will be used.

- signup (registration) for new user. The form will be validated and the user's info will be stored (localstorage).


TASKS:

# Add new button for signup process (registration) along with the signin (login): check the naming and make them consistent

# Add new form for signup process (registration)

# Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event for each button

# Toggle/Hide-Show elements: the forms and cart should not overlap each other

# Inside the form add links ("Not yet" / "Already registered")

# Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event for submit of login form

# Create 2 other button for User-logged and Logout

# Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event for submit of registration form and create a new user item in localStorage
